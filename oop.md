## What is OOP

**OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** is a programming paradigm where code is structured using **classes** and **objects**.

---

## Object

An **object** is an entity that encapsulates **data (attributes)** and **functions (methods)**.

**Example:**  
A **Car** is an object that can have properties like `color`, `name`, and methods like `brake()` and `speed()`.

---

## Class

A **class** is a **blueprint** for creating objects.  
It defines the **properties** and **methods** that an object will have.

## Why OOP is Necessary

1. **Simplifies complex problems** by breaking them into smaller, connected classes or objects.
2. **Enhances security** through features like _encapsulation_ and _data hiding_.
3. **Increases reusability** — multiple objects can be created from the same blueprint.
4. **Supports flexibility** — features like _inheritance_ and _polymorphism_ allow extending or modifying functionality without breaking existing code.
5. **Improves maintainability** — modular and structured code is easier to update and manage.
